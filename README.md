Sure, Anand! Here's a professional and clean **README** you can use for your GitHub repository for your ROS2 learning project so far. You can update it later as you add hardware projects.

# **ROS2 Learning Journey - Anand Gawai**

This repository contains my **ROS2 Humble simulation and beginner robotics projects**, including publisher and subscriber nodes, and experiments with Python nodes.

---

## **📌 Project Overview**

* Built ROS2 **Publisher and Subscriber nodes** in Python
* Learned to debug **Python errors** inside ROS2 packages
* Explored ROS2 concepts:

  * Nodes
  * Topics
  * Parameters
  * Callbacks
* Set up GitHub version control to **track and share progress**

## **📂 Project Structure**

```text
ros2_ws/
├── src/
│   └── my_robot_pkg/
│       ├── my_robot_pkg/
│       │   ├── temprature_publisher.py
│       │   ├── temprature_subscriber.py
│       │   └── other sample nodes...
│       └── setup.py
├── install/
├── build/
└── log/
```

* `temprature_publisher.py` → Publishes simulated temperature values
* `temprature_subscriber.py` → Subscribes to the temperature topic and prints values
* Other files are experimental ROS2 nodes (turtle controller, subscriber/publisher templates)

---

## **🚀 How to Run**

1. Source your ROS2 workspace:

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

2. Run the Publisher node:

```bash
ros2 run my_robot_pkg temprature_publisher
```

3. Run the Subscriber node (in a new terminal):

```bash
ros2 run my_robot_pkg temprature_subscriber
```

4. Check topics and nodes:

```bash
ros2 node list
ros2 topic list
ros2 topic echo /temperature
```

---

## **🛠 Skills Learned**

* ROS2 Humble environment setup
* Python scripting for ROS2 nodes
* Publisher-Subscriber communication
* Git & GitHub version control
* Debugging Python and ROS2 errors

If you want, I can **also make a simpler “Day 10 snapshot version” README** with images/diagrams of publisher-subscriber nodes — this will **look very professional on GitHub** and catch recruiters’ attention.

Do you want me to do that?
